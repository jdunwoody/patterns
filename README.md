A Catalogue of Design Patterns in Objective C

# Factory
Is responsible for instantiating a particular object, removing that concern from the object itself or its clients.
As a creator pattern it can assist in dependency injection and making testing easier by not requiring the stubbing of an initialiser. 
Factories can be classes themselves or static methods on the classes being built.

# Builder
Is a stateful creation pattern that is useful for creating complex objects that can require a number of optional steps.

[See the code](../blob/master/LICENSE)

# Delegation
Is a procedural pattern where the object delegates the implmentation of a method to another object.

[See the code](../blob/master/LICENSE)

# Composition
Is an abstraction pattern that allow a class to provide functionality from more than one source class.

[See the code](../blob/master/LICENSE)

# Proxy
A wrapper object that is used in place of another object, offers additional functionality on top of what is provided by the object being proxied.

[See the code](../blob/master/LICENSE)

# Decorator
A wrapper class that provides delegates through to its wrapped object while providing additional functionality.

[See the code](../blob/master/LICENSE)

# Facade
A wrapper class that provides a nicer/restricted interface to an existing object

[See the code](../blob/master/LICENSE)

# Adapter
A wrapper class provides a new interface to an existing object

[See the code](../blob/master/LICENSE)
